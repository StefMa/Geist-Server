## Deploy

#### Credentials
Copy the credentials from your Firebase Project into the [`firebase_base.js`](js/firebase_base.js).

See [`Add Firebase to your Project`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup).

#### Upload to Firebase
After you have installed the Firebase CLI tool

`npm install -g firebase-tools`

You can just run

`firebase deploy --project $YOUR_ðŸ”¥BASE_PROJECTID`

## Update/Release

### Version
If we update the server it is mandatory to update the [version](version) file.

The version number should follow [these](http://semver.org/) specs.

The name is just a random name and will be generated with [this](http://www.codenamegenerator.com/) tool.
Don't use a prefix and suffix. The dictionary should point to `US Countries`

### GitHub Release
After we published we have to create a [GitHub Release](https://github.com/StefMa/Geist-Server/releases).

For that we needed a tag which will be named as `release/vX.X.X`.
The X.X.X represent the version we specified with the step above.

It is also necessary to add a changelog.
